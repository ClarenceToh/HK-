Trading Strategy - Stock Filter

The strategy was inspired by The Complete Turtle Trader, a book by Michael Covel.
From Investopedia - Turtles were taught very specifically how to implement a trend-following strategy. The idea is that the "trend is your friend," so you should buy futures breaking out to the upside of trading ranges and sell short downside breakouts.

I think what drew me into this strategy is that it relies heavily on what the market is thinking. 
Positive rallies will rally higher and investors will pour in money or if price drops too much, it may cause massive short selling on a stock.
